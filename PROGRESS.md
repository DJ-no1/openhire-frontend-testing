# Project Progress Log: OpenHire Backend

## July 2025

### 1. Project Planning & Vision

- Defined the main workflow: recruiters post jobs, candidates apply and take AI-driven interviews, recruiters review results.
- Documented the project vision and workflow in `GOAL.md`.

### 2. Supabase Integration

- Set up a Supabase project and configured environment variables in `.env`.
- Installed the community Supabase Python client (`supabase-py`).
- Created a dedicated `supabase_client.py` for initializing and reusing the Supabase client in the backend.

### 3. Database Schema Design

- Discussed and finalized the core table structure for users, jobs, applications, interviews, and interview artifacts.
- Created all core tables in Supabase using the SQL Editor:
  - `users`
  - `jobs`
  - `applications`
  - `interviews`
  - `interview_artifacts`
- Decided to postpone the notifications table for now.

### 4. Backend Data Models

- Created `models/supabase_models.py` with Pydantic models for all core tables.
- Added detailed descriptions to all models and fields for clarity and maintainability.

### 5. Best Practices & Architecture

- Established a clear separation between database schema (in Supabase) and API validation (Pydantic models in backend).
- Discussed the use of Supabase Storage for saving files (e.g., interview screenshots) and storing their URLs in the database.

**Next Steps:**

**Immediate Next Moves & Recent Progress:**

1. Implemented FastAPI endpoints for user creation and job creation using the Supabase client and Pydantic models.

   - Added `/users` endpoint to create users (recruiter or candidate).
   - Added `/jobs` endpoint to create jobs, restricted to users with the recruiter role.
   - Enforced recruiter-only job creation by checking user role before allowing job creation.
   - Improved error handling for duplicate emails and database errors, with clear status codes and messages.

2. Added job listing endpoint:

   - `/jobs` GET endpoint now supports filtering by recruiter, job type, and title.
   - Added sorting options (`sort_by`, `sort_order`) for job listings (e.g., by date, salary, title).

3. Added job update and delete endpoints:

   - `/jobs/{job_id}` PUT endpoint allows recruiters to update job details (with recruiter authorization).
   - `/jobs/{job_id}` DELETE endpoint allows recruiters to delete jobs (with recruiter authorization).

4. Improved recruiter authorization for job update and delete actions.

5. Next steps:
   - Add authentication and role-based access control to protect endpoints (e.g., only recruiters can post jobs, only candidates can apply).
   - Integrate file upload logic for resumes and interview artifacts using Supabase Storage.
   - Test all endpoints with real data and iterate as needed.
   - (Optional) Add notifications table and logic for in-app alerts when ready.

You can now continue development from this plan or start a new chat for the next phase.
