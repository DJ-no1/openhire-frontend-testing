## Design Principles Applied

### Typography Hierarchy

1. **Badges:** 14px, medium weight, subtle backgrounds with borders
2. **Headlines:** 48-64px (4xl-5xl), bold, single color emphasis
3. **Subheadings:** 18-20px, gray color, concise messaging
4. **Body Text:** 14-16px, relaxed leading

### Color Usage

- **Reduced gradient usage** - Only for emphasis, not backgrounds
- **Single color highlights** - Blue, purple, green, yellow for different sections
- **Better contrast** - Gray 50/900 for backgrounds instead of gradients
- **Consistent borders** - Gray 200/800 for all card borders

### Spacing

- **Reduced section padding:** 80-112px (20-28 rem) instead of 96px (24 rem)
- **Tighter card spacing:** 24px gaps instead of 32px
- **Better internal padding:** 24-32px in cards instead of 32-40px

### Visual Elements

- **Added product mockup** in hero section
- **Simplified icons** - Smaller, cleaner presentation
- **Better badges** - With borders and subtle backgrounds
- **Cleaner cards** - Less shadow, more borders

## Responsive Behavior

- Hero section stacks on mobile (mockup hidden)
- All sections maintain proper spacing on mobile
- Text sizes scale appropriately
- Cards stack properly in grid layouts

## Files Modified

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Complete hero and sections redesign

## Next Steps

Consider:

1. Adding real product screenshots to the mockup
2. A/B testing the new CTAs
3. Adding animation on scroll
4. Creating mobile-specific mockup view
5. Adding customer logo carousel
