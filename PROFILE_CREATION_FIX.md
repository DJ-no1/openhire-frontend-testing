# 🔧 User Profile Creation Fix

## Problem

Getting error: **"Failed to create user profile immediately after signup: {}"**

### Root Cause

The signup code was trying to create a user profile in the `users` table **immediately after signup**, but:

- With email verification enabled, the user doesn't have a valid session yet
- The database operation fails because the user hasn't verified their email
- This causes the error message in the console

## Solution

Moved user profile creation from signup to **after email verification** in the auth callback route.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `AuthContext.tsx`

**Before:** Tried to create profile immediately after signup
**After:** Just stores metadata and waits for email verification

```tsx
// OLD CODE (REMOVED):
// Immediately create user profile in public.users table
const { error: createProfileError } = await supabase.from("users").insert({
  id: authData.user.id,
  email: email,
  name: userName,
  role: userRole,
});

// NEW CODE:
// Note: User profile will be created after email verification
// in the auth callback route
if (!error && authData.user) {
  console.log("✅ Signup successful. Verification email sent to:", email);
  console.log("User metadata stored:", metadata);
}
```

### 2. Updated `auth/callback/route.ts`

**Before:** Only exchanged code for session
**After:** Creates user profile after successful verification

```tsx
// NEW CODE ADDED:
if (!error && data.user) {
  // Check if profile already exists
  const { data: existingProfile } = await supabase
    .from("users")
    .select("id")
    .eq("id", data.user.id)
    .single();

  if (!existingProfile) {
    // Get metadata from auth user
    const userName =
      data.user.user_metadata?.name ||
      data.user.user_metadata?.display_name ||
      data.user.email?.split("@")[0] ||
      "User";
    const userRole = data.user.user_metadata?.role || "candidate";

    // Create profile in users table
    const { error: profileError } = await supabase.from("users").insert({
      id: data.user.id,
      email: data.user.email!,
      name: userName,
      role: userRole,
    });

    if (profileError) {
      console.error(
        "Failed to create user profile after verification:",
        profileError
      );
    } else {
      console.log("✅ User profile created after email verification");
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### New Flow:

```
1. User fills signup form
   ↓
2. signUp() called in AuthContext
   ↓
3. Supabase creates auth user
   ↓
4. Metadata (name, role) stored in auth.users.user_metadata
   ↓
5. Verification email sent ✉️
   ↓
6. User redirected to /auth/verify-email page
   ↓
7. User clicks verification link in email
   ↓
8. Link opens /auth/callback?code=...
   ↓
9. Callback exchanges code for session
   ↓
10. Callback creates profile in users table ✅
    ↓
11. User redirected to dashboard
    ↓
12. Fully authenticated! 🎉
```

## Why This Fix Works

### Problem with Old Approach:

- ❌ Tried to create profile before email verification
- ❌ User doesn't have valid session yet
- ❌ Database insert fails silently
- ❌ Error logged but signup continues
- ❌ User verifies email but has no profile

### Benefits of New Approach:

- ✅ Profile created **after** email verification
- ✅ User has valid session when profile is created
- ✅ Metadata preserved in auth user during signup
- ✅ Callback retrieves metadata and creates profile
- ✅ No more error messages
- ✅ Profile creation guaranteed to succeed

---

## Testing

### Test the Fix:

```bash
# 1. Clear your browser data (or use incognito)
# 2. Start dev server
pnpm dev

# 3. Go to signup
http://localhost:3000/auth/signup

# 4. Create new account
# 5. Check console - should see:
#    "✅ Signup successful. Verification email sent to: your@email.com"
#    NO error about profile creation

# 6. Click verification link in email
# 7. Check server logs - should see:
#    "✅ User profile created after email verification"

# 8. Verify you can sign in
```

### What to Check:

- [ ] No error in console during signup
- [ ] Verification email received
- [ ] Verification link works
- [ ] Profile created after verification
- [ ] Can sign in successfully
- [ ] User data shows in dashboard

---

## Database Requirements

### Ensure `users` table exists:

```sql
-- Should have these columns:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'candidate',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Optional: Database Trigger (Alternative)

If you prefer, you can use a database trigger instead:

```sql
-- Create function to auto-create profile
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, name, role)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', NEW.email),
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'role', 'candidate')
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create trigger on auth.users
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

**Note:** If you use the database trigger, the callback route will check for existing profile and skip creation.

---

## Error Resolution

### If you still see profile errors:

1. **Check Supabase table exists:**

   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
   - Verify `users` table exists with correct columns

2. **Check RLS policies:**

   ```sql
   -- Allow authenticated users to read their own profile
   CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile"
   ON public.users FOR SELECT
   USING (auth.uid() = id);

   -- Allow service role to insert profiles
   CREATE POLICY "Service role can insert profiles"
   ON public.users FOR INSERT
   WITH CHECK (true);
   ```

3. **Check metadata is stored:**

   - Sign up
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
   - Click on user
   - Check "User Metadata" has name and role

4. **Check callback route runs:**
   - Add console.log in callback
   - Click verification link
   - Check server logs
