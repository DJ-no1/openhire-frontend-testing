# ðŸš¨ WebSocket Connection Issues - SOLUTION

## Problem

You're getting WebSocket connection errors because:

1. **Heroku Free/Basic tiers don't support WebSocket connections by default**
2. **WebSocket requires special configuration on Heroku**
3. **Your backend might not have WebSocket endpoints configured**

## Quick Solution

I've updated your `.env.local` to use a **mixed configuration**:

- âœ… **HTTP API calls** â†’ Production Heroku (`https://openhire-2764a0388beb.herokuapp.com`)
- âœ… **WebSocket connections** â†’ Local development (`ws://localhost:8000`)

This means:

- Job listings, resume analysis, etc. will use your production backend
- Interview WebSocket features will require your local backend to be running

## Current Configuration

```bash
# Mixed mode: HTTP to production, WebSocket to localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://openhire-2764a0388beb.herokuapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000
```

## To Use This Setup

### Option 1: Run Local Backend for WebSocket Features

1. Start your local AI backend server on port 8000
2. HTTP API calls will go to production
3. WebSocket connections will go to localhost

### Option 2: Use Full Localhost During Development

Update your `.env.local` to:

```bash
# Full localhost development
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8000
```

### Option 3: Configure WebSocket on Heroku (Recommended for Production)

To fix WebSocket on Heroku, you need to:

1. **Upgrade to Heroku Standard/Performance plans** (supports WebSocket)
2. **Configure your backend** to handle WebSocket connections properly
3. **Use WSS (secure WebSocket)** instead of WS
4. **Update your backend CORS** to allow WebSocket connections

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate testing**: Make sure your local backend is running on port 8000
2. **For production**: Configure WebSocket support on your Heroku backend
3. **Alternative**: Consider using HTTP long polling instead of WebSocket for interview features

The HTTP API features (job listings, resume upload, etc.) should work fine with the current setup!
